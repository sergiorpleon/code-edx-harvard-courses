      <h2>
        Objective
      </h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        The objective of the game is to capture the other player's king. The capture is never completed, but once the
        king is attacked and cannot escape capture, it is said to be checkmated and the game ends.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Placing the Pieces
      </h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        When the game begins, one player controls sixteen white pieces and another player controls 16 black pieces.
        The color assigned to each player is usually drawn by lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        To place the pieces, the board is placed so that in the row closest to each player, the rightmost square is
        white. In the row closest to each player, the rooks will occupy the corners, next to them will be the knights,
        and next to them will be the bishops. The two central squares will be occupied by the queen, on
        the square of her color, and by the king on the square of the opposite color, so that both pieces are facing
        (in the same column) as the opponent's pieces. The pawns will go in the row immediately following in front of
        each
        of the pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rooks, knights and bishops closest to the king are usually called king's
        (example: king's rook) and those furthest away, closest to the queen are called queen's
        (example: queen's bishop). Likewise, the side where both kings are at
        the origin is usually called the kingside and the other side the queenside.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Movement of the pieces
      </h2>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The king can move in any direction (vertically, horizontally and diagonally) advancing or retreating one
          square only (except in castling, in which it moves two squares).
        </li>
        <li>The queen, also known as the queen, can move in any direction (vertically, horizontally, and
          diagonally), moving forward or backward on the board as many squares as desired, until it hits another piece
          or the
          edge of the board.
        </li>
        <li>
          The bishop can only move diagonally, as many squares as desired.
          The rook can only move vertically and horizontally, not diagonally, as many squares as desired.</li>
        <li>
          The knight, according to the official definition, can move to the nearest square that is not on its
          own row, column, or diagonal, although for simplicity it is said that it moves by advancing two squares
          vertically and one
          horizontally, or vice versa, making an ‘L’ movement, being the only piece that can jump over the
          other pieces.</li>
        <li>
          The pawn, in its first move, can advance one or two squares vertically; After its first move, it can only
          advance one square in each vertical movement. Unlike the rest of the pieces, it cannot go backwards and cannot
          capture opposing pieces that are on the same column on which it moves; it can only do so if they are one
          square diagonally from it (except in the case of an en passant capture).
          A pawn must transform into a bishop, knight, rook or queen of the same color, at the player's choice, if it is
          able to reach the last row of the board opposite its side, so a pawn can acquire enormous tactical power in
          certain positions where it has no opposition to "crown."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        Rules for the movement of pieces
      </h2>
      <hr>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Pieces cannot jump over one another in their movement (with the exception of the knight, which can
          jump over others, moving in an ‘L’, and the rook, when castling).
          A piece cannot occupy a square occupied by another piece of the same color, but it can occupy a square
          occupied by another of the
          opponent's color, by removing it from the board. This action is known as "taking" or "capturing," and is
          voluntary, at the
          discretion of the player.</li>
        <li>
          Squares to which a piece can move are said to be controlled or covered by it. If
          a
          piece is within the squares controlled by a piece of the opposing color, it is attacked by that
          piece.</li>
        <li>
          An attacked piece is not allowed to leave its position, when doing so would threaten the king behind the
          attacked piece on that row, file, or diagonal.
        </li>
        <li>
          The king is the only piece that cannot move or pass through squares controlled by opposing pieces.
        </li>
        <li>A move that attacks the king is known as a check; it is mandatoryor for the player whose king is attacked to
          get out of
          check. If there is no possible defense against a check, the king is in checkmate. That is the goal and whoever
          inflicts it on the opponent's king wins.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>
        Game</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>
        The beginning of the game</h3>
      <p>The game begins in the position shown in the picture. White (the player with the lighter pieces)
        makes the first move. Afterwards each player has only one turn to move. In fact, a player may only make one
        move in each turn. In other words, you cannot skip a turn to move.
      </p>
      <p>In each turn, a player may only move one piece (with the sole exception of a special move called
        castling, in which the king moves two squares to the right or left and the rook is placed on its
        opposite side). </p>
      <h3>
        Playing the game </h3>
      <p>A move consists of placing a piece on a different square, following the movement rules for each piece.
        A player can capture a piece from his opponent by moving one of his own pieces to the square where his
        opponent's piece is.
        The opponent's piece is removed from the board and remains out of play for the rest of the game.
      </p>
      <h3>End of the game </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The game is won by the player who:
          <ul>
            <li>Has successfully checkmated his opponent's king.
            </li>
            <li>Has his opponent resigned.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Another possible outcome is a draw, which occurs in any of the following cases:
          <ul>
            <li>By mutual agreement
            </li>
            <li>When neither player has enough pieces to checkmate.
            </li>
            <li>If the same position of the pieces on the board is repeated three times.
            </li>
            <li>When a player, without being in check, cannot make any legal move on his turn, which is called a
              stalemate.
            </li>
            <li>When after fifty consecutive moves no capture has been made or a pawn has been advanced.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
