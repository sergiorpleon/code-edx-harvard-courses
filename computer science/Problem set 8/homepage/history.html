                The predecessor of all games in the chess family, it presumably arose in India
                northern as a game for four. This primitive chess would be known as chaturanga in Persia and after
                The conquest by the Arabs would continue to develop following the Islamic expansions.

                The Arabs conquered the Sassanid empire between 632 and 651. During that time they entered
                contact with chess. Through them came the game, which only by phonetic adaptation is called shatranj, to
                his
                first era of great splendor. The Arabs contributed decisively to its expansion.

                The game entered Europe through several routes. One of the first contacts occurred through
                Byzantine Empire, especially Constantinople. The Varangians brought the game from Constantinople
                (Miklagard, for them) to Russia, where it began to be played from the beginning of the 8th century.
                Through the
                Arabs brought chess to Spain in the 9th century. The oldest European text, which contains the
                rules of the game, probably comes from between the years 900 and 950 and from northern Italy.

                Towards the end of the 15th century they began to change the rules decisively. They would regulate
                movements
                of the pawn, the bishop and the queen. The pawn could now take two steps on the first move (until then
                one
                only); the bishop, at any distance (until then it only jumped two squares); and the lady, at her
                discretion
                in any of the eight directions (previously called alferza, it advanced only one square in the direction
                diagonal), suddenly going from being a relatively weak figure to becoming the strongest
                of the board and to provide great spectacularity to the game.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through these adjustments the game was changed completely, the birth of modern chess. The new game
                It required different tactics and openings. The exercise gained speed and, at the same time, popularity.
                These innovations were probably introduced in Valencia between the years 1470 and 1490 and were
                manifested in
                he
                Valencian poem Scachs d'amor, the oldest document on modern chess. The composers and
                Once famous chess players were Francesc de Castellvi, Narcis Vinyoles and Bernat Fenollar. In the year
                1495,
                Francesch Vicent published the first chess book with the title Libre dels Jochs Partits dels Schacs in
                Name of 100 sort and compost. Currently there is no copy of this incunabulum, although there are
                reasons to believe that some specimen should be preserved, in fact a juicy reward is offered to whoever
                find one. In 2005, the historian José Antonio Garzón (Chelva, 1966) through the study of
                some
                manuscripts that are preserved in Italy managed to recreate the book, a fact that he captured in his
                book The Return
                by Francesch Vicent: The story of the birth and expansion of modern chess.

                advanced, the Elo score has been established, which allows us to get an idea of ​​how good the

                The use of systematic searches to design computer chess programs began with the work
                of Claude Elwood Shannon. However, we could cite as a precursor the Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres
                Quevedo, who designed a finite state automaton capable of playing king and rook endgames.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was not until the 1970s and 1980s that advances in computing power and improved
                programs led to a great improvement in computer play. Soon they began to beat even grandmasters in rapid
                games and
                later in ordinary tournament conditions. This advance culminated in the defeat of world champion Garry
                Kasparov by IBM's supercomputer Deep Blue in 1997,
                with the score 3.5-2.5. More recently, in November 2006, the Deep Fritz program, running
                simply on a personal computer with an Intel Core 2 Duo processor, also managed to defeat
                then world champion Vladimir Kramnik by a score of 4-2.

                In December 2017, Alphazero outperformed Stockfish and other top chess programs. Unlike
                other programs, AlphaZero, the artificial intelligence created by Deep Mind, owned by Google since
                2014, is not based on human knowledge. Its understanding of chess, beyond the basic rules,
                comes solely from its ability to self-learn. After playing almost five million games
                for four hours against itself, AlphaZero acquired the same knowledge as humans have in
                almost fourteen hundred years.
